BIS API integration with OpenBB

This repo is a test bed for development of a generic integration of BIS api into OpenBB. 
The problem with datasets at the BIS is their complexity - with many sub parameters to a particular table which may not transfer to other tables.

The BISDataGuide.csv file has a list of important datasets and some of the options the can take. It is not complete.
